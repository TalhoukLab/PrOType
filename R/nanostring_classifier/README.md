## NanoString Classifier

---


`nanostring_classifier` contains the following directories:

* `outputs`: outputs generated by the `2_post_processing` are placed here
* `utils`: utility/helper functions required for the analysis
* `data`: data provided to you with the name `data` should replace this directory, which contains all necessary data dependencies for the post processing. This is the same data file used in `2_post_processing`.

---

To run the NanoString classifier, the following should be run in sequential order:

1. `1-validate_nanostring.R`: The optimal model and batch-correction method are validated on the overlapping samples between Affymetrix and Nanostring. Evaluation between array, NanoString, and published labels is conducted.
2. `2-predict_all_nanostring.R`: The optimal model (adaboost) is used to predict all samples of NanoString (batch 1-4.)
