## NanoString Classifier

---


`nanostring_classifier` contains the following directories:

* `outputs`: outputs generated by the `2_post_processing` are placed here
* `utils`: utility/helper functions required for the analysis
* `data`: data provided to you with the name `data` should replace this directory, which contains all necessary data dependencies for the post processing. This is the same data file used in `2_post_processing`.

---

To run the NanoString classifier, the following should be run in sequential order:

1. Open the Rproj `nanostring_classifier.Rproj`
2. `step3_ValidationNanoString`: The optimal model and batch-correction method are validated on the overlapping samples between Affymetrix and Nanostring.
3. `step4_PredictNanoString`: The optimal model (adaboost) is used to predict all samples of NanoString.
4. Close the Rproj
